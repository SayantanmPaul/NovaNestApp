## Project NovaNest

- Novanest uses MetaMask for wallet management and Ethereum transactions for a crowdfunding platform for your ambitious projects built with ThirdWeb.
- Users will be able to create new campaigns, set a funding goal, and receive funds from supporters.
- All the transactions will be 100% received by the campaign creators from supporters, there's no service charge included.
- All transactions will be transparent and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure and trustless environment for crowdfunding.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.
